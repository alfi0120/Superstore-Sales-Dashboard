## Analysis
From the dashboard above, there are many insights that we can get:
- Over the past four years (2014-2017), the superstore gained $2,297,201 in sales and a profit of only $286,397.
- The West region contributed the most sales by earning $725,458 of sales followed by the East region, Central region, and South region while California, New York, and Texas were the top 3 states that contributed the most sales and profit to the company which respectively from the West, East, and Central region. Moreover, Washington comes after the top 3 states that have the most sales and profit that contributed to the highest sales region, the West.
- Sales patterns always fluctuated over the years, peaked towards the end of the year, and decreased during mid-year.
- The Technology category emerged as the leading contributor to sales and profit within the Phones sub-category as the top sales and Copiers as the most profitable for the category.
- An intriguing observation on the Furniture category reveals that despite being the second highest sales, it yields the lowest profit among the three categories. Specifically, the Tables and Bookcases sub-category resulted in a loss for the company instead of generating profit.
- The Consumer segment stands out as the most financially rewarding segment for the superstore.
- The majority of customers opt for Standard Class shipping, indicating a prevalent cost-saving strategy among the customers.

## Recommendations
- Superstore should implement tailored marketing strategies based on the sales performances in various regions.
- Given the peak in sales towards the year's end, consider launching a special campaign tailored for this season.
- Considering the high sales and profitability of Phones sub-category, expanding the introduction or increasing the promotion of this sub-category would be a logical step.
- Conducting a thorough analysis of the issue in the Tables and Bookcases sub-category is crucial to prevent financial losses for the company.
- Leverage the Consumer segment as the primary focus for targeted campaigns, as most of customers belong to this segment.
